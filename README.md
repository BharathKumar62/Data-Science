Context and objective
We will be working on a data set that comes from the real estate industry in Boston (US). Your task as a Data Scientist, is to use machine learning techniques to delve into the 
given data and predict the median value of owner-occupied homes in 1000 USD's. 
The target variable in this dataset is MEDV and you are given a new unseen test dataset on which you will have to predict the median value.

Context and objective
A combined-cycle power plant uses both gas and a steam turbine together to produce up to 50 percent more electricity from the same fuel than a traditional simple-cycle plant. The waste heat from the gas turbine is routed to the nearby steam turbine, which generates extra power.
All the UN Member States have to submit a report on the combined cycle power plant to the United Nations. The Power Plant officials of Mexico are devising a way to predict the net hourly electrical energy output (PE) of the plant. You are appointed as the chief for this operation. Create a Machine Learning Model to solve this problem efficiently.
